Project Tile : Smart Bus Management System(SBM)
About Project: 
It is an application designed for students availing of the 
bus facility. The basic objective behind developing this 
application is to provide ease to students and their parents 
regarding the bus facility because students have to wait for a 
long time for the bus to arrive at the bus stop at the time of 
departure to college. The students, as well as the parents, can 
track the status of the bus location, they can check the busâ€™s
timing, and if their bus has changed and the application will 
have the schedule and the information of the routes of the 
buses
